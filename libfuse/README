RozoFS fuse library

RozoFS can be started either with the fuse.ko or rozo.ko modules.

rozo.ko module is checked first
when it is not present, RozoFS  starts with the installed fuse module.

the patched fuse.ko module and the rozo.ko module provide the same
functionality. 

the rozo.ko module is preferred when RozoFS runs on a server on which some
application might use fuse for their own purpose. Because of the modification that have been done in the legacy fuse module for RozoFS, it might be possible that this module does not work friendly with some application that expect the fuse legacy module.

Directory layout:
-----------------

- fuse-2.9.7:
it is the directory that contains the fuse source code.

- bin,include,lib and share:
Theses are the directory under which the libfuse will install all its stuff when
calling make install.

Compiling the RozoFS fuse library
---------------------------------
It is not necessary to run configure, just do the following

cd ./fuse-2.9.7
make
make install

rozofsmount link
----------------
because the decision to use either rozo.ko or fuse.ko is located in the fuse
library, it is not more possible to use a dynamic linking with libfuse at the
generation time of rozofsmount.

Instead, the fuse library MUST be statically linked with rozofsmount.

the libfuse used by rozofsmount is ./lib/libfuse.a.

The CMakeLists.txt of rozofsmount has been modified for doing it:

target_link_libraries(rozofsmount rozofs fuse dl ${PTHREAD_LIBRARY}  ${UUID_LIBRARY} ${CRYPT_LIBRARY} ${CONFIG_LIBRARY} ${NUMA_LIBRARY})
